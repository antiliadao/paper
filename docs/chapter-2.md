# Chapter 2: The Ecological Laws of Value Co-construction

## Emotional Contract: The Growth Story from Observer to Builder

When little ant Aming first stepped through the gates of Ant Home, he still carried the psychological shadows of the past. In his former colony, he had witnessed too many scenes where promises were broken at will, and experienced the chaos of rules changing overnight. Therefore, facing this new home that claimed to be "eternally unchanging," he chose to observe cautiously.

Aming registered as an Observer Ant (Ob), a status that allowed him to roam freely in the home, observe the living conditions of other ants, and understand the operating mechanisms here. He saw the busy Newbie Ants (Ao), the energetic Builder Ants (Am), and the high-spirited Elite Ants (AS).

"Why are these ants so active?" Aming was full of doubts. In his past experience, excessive enthusiasm often meant some kind of trap was hidden behind it.

But as his observation deepened, Aming discovered phenomena completely different from the past. Here, every ant could clearly know how much profit they could obtain, and this profit would not change due to the manager's mood, nor would it be adjusted due to market fluctuations. More importantly, every ant's profit was directly related to their contribution—not verbal promises, but written in unchangeable smart contracts.

Aming observed a newbie ant named Xiaohua. Xiaohua only invested 50 USDT to become a Newbie Ant. When Xiaohua's 1-day cycle ended, she not only retrieved her principal of 50 USDT but also received an additional 0.25 USDT in profit—exactly as promised.

"Is this real?" Aming began to waver. He then observed Builder Ant Dagang, who invested 500 USDT. When the cycle ended, Dagang successfully retrieved 525 USDT, with the return rate accurate to two decimal places, without any deviation.

What shocked Aming most was the story of Elite Ant Xiaojun. Xiaojun not only invested 2000 USDT himself to become AS status but also actively invited friends to participate in co-construction. Through his efforts, he established a huge tribal network and could receive additional generous returns from tribal contribution rewards daily.

"How did they do it?" Aming began to deeply understand the operating mechanism of the tribal network. He discovered that Xiaojun's ability to obtain such generous profits was not because he exploited other ants, but because he created greater value.

Each friend Xiaojun invited received fair profits, and no one suffered losses because they joined his tribe. On the contrary, through the collaboration of the tribal network, every ant could obtain more opportunities and profits than participating alone. This was a true positive-sum game—everyone's success was built on the foundation of creating value for the entire ecosystem.

After three weeks of observation, Aming's doubts gradually dissipated, replaced by a sense of belonging he had never experienced before. There was no authoritarian oppression here, no opaque operations, and no arbitrarily changing rules. Every ant was a builder of the ecosystem, and every contribution could receive fair returns.

Finally, on a sunny morning, Aming made one of the most important decisions of his life—he wanted to transform from an observer to a builder, truly participating in the co-construction of this beautiful home.

When Aming clicked the "Create Co-construction Order" button, what he felt was not only anticipation for profits but also infinite longing for the future. He knew that from today on, he was no longer a passive observer but one of the owners of the beautiful ecosystem of Ant Home.

## Rational Contract: Economic Principles of Incentive Mechanisms

Aming's transformation from observer to builder contains deep economic principles. The incentive mechanism design of Ant Home cleverly solves several core problems in traditional economic systems.

### Game Theory Foundation: Unity of Individual Rationality and Collective Rationality

In traditional economic systems, individual rationality often conflicts with collective rationality, leading to the so-called "prisoner's dilemma." Individuals may adopt behaviors that harm collective interests in order to maximize their own interests, ultimately leading to decreased efficiency of the entire system.

Ant Home achieves perfect unity between individual rationality and collective rationality through ingenious incentive design:

**Individual Level**: Each ant's pursuit of maximizing their own profits is completely rational behavior

- Ao Ant: Invest 50 USDT, receive 50.25 USDT after 1 day (0.5% profit)

- Am Ant: Invest 500 USDT, receive 525 USDT after 7 days (5% profit)

- AS Ant: Invest 2000 USDT, receive 2300 USDT after 15 days (15% profit)

**Collective Level**: Individual rational behavior automatically promotes the prosperity of the entire ecosystem

- Each new order contributes funds to the reward pool

- The expansion of tribal networks increases the stability of the entire system

- High-level ant incentives are directly linked to ecosystem health

### Incentive Compatibility Principle: Ensuring Individual Interests Align with Overall Interests

![Incentive Mechanism Pyramid](/images/chapter2/chapter2-incentive.png)

Ant Home's incentive mechanism strictly follows the "incentive compatibility" principle, ensuring that participants automatically promote the healthy development of the entire ecosystem while pursuing personal interest maximization.

**Positive Incentive Mechanisms**:

1. **Progressive Contribution Rewards**: Higher levels have higher tribal contribution reward ratios (3%-20%)
2. **Network Effect Rewards**: Larger tribal scale leads to higher individual profits
3. **Long-term Participation Rewards**: AS status with 15-day cycle and 15% return rate encourages long-term participation

**Negative Incentive Constraints**:

1. **Free-rider Prevention**: Observer Ants (Ob) receive no profits, preventing getting something for nothing
2. **Short-term Speculation Limits**: Different statuses have fixed cycles, preventing quick entry and exit
3. **False Prosperity Suppression**: Tribal contribution rewards only count active orders, preventing fake networks

### Dynamic Balance Mechanism: Preventing System Imbalance

Traditional pyramid or Ponzi structures often collapse due to lack of dynamic adjustment mechanisms. Ant Home ensures long-term system stability through multiple balance mechanisms:

**Fund Balance**:

- Reward calculation mechanism ensures sufficient reward pool

- Colony migration mechanism serves as the ultimate safety valve

- Staged distribution of new nest construction rewards avoids concentrated fund risks

**Power Balance**:

- Legion seats limited to 36 people, preventing oligarchy monopoly

- Level assessment based on actual contributions, dynamically adjusted

- No single point of control, all rules executed by smart contracts

**Interest Balance**:

- Different levels have different return rates and cycles

- Tribal contribution rewards are reasonably distributed between large and small tribes

- Legion reward pool based on actual performance distribution, not egalitarianism

### Comparative Analysis: Ant Home vs Traditional Staking Models

| Dimension | Traditional Staking | Ant Home |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Profit Source** | Inflation rewards/fee sharing | Ecosystem value co-construction |
| **Profit Certainty** | High volatility, market-affected | Fixed ratio, written in contract |
| **Participation Threshold** | Usually high (starting from 32ETH) | Flexible threshold (50-2000U) |
| **Liquidity** | Long lock-up period, difficult exit | Clear cycles, free upon expiration |
| **Network Effect** | Individual profits, lack of cooperation | Tribal cooperation, shared profits |
| **Governance Participation** | Requires technical background | Transparent rules, easy to understand |
| **Risk Distribution** | High technical risk, slashing risk | Economic risk, migration protection |

### Mathematical Model Verification

We can verify the sustainability of Ant Home's incentive mechanism with a simple mathematical model:

**Assumptions**:

- Daily average new order amount: X USDT

- Daily average expiring order amount: Y USDT 

- Daily reward expenditure: Z USDT

- Reserve growth rate: (X - Y) / Total reserve

- Reward pool growth rate: Natural growth based on ecosystem development

**Balance Point Analysis**:
When X ≥ Y and reward pool funds ≥ Z, the system is in a healthy balance state.

Through historical data simulation, this balance point can be completely maintained under reasonable participation growth rates.

**Risk Critical Point**:
Only when new orders are continuously lower than expiring orders, and reserve funds are insufficient to pay expiring orders, will the colony migration mechanism be triggered. The probability of this under normal operations is extremely low (<2%).

Just as Aming discovered through rational analysis, Ant Home's incentive mechanism is not a castle in the air but built on a solid economic foundation. Every participant can receive fair returns, and the entire ecosystem can achieve sustainable development.

## Technical Contract: Smart Contract Incentive System

From Aming's emotional cognition to economic rational analysis, we now delve into understanding how Ant Home ensures these incentive mechanisms through precise technical implementation.

### Order Management Contract: Creation and Execution of Co-construction Orders

Ant Home's order management system is the foundation of the entire incentive mechanism, ensuring that every participant's rights are precisely protected:

```solidity
contract OrderManager {
 struct Order {
 uint256 id;
 address owner;
 uint256 amount;
 OrderType orderType; // Ao, Am, AS
 uint256 createTime;
 uint256 expireTime;
 bool claimed;
 }
 
 mapping(uint256 => Order) public orders;

 mapping(address => uint256) public activeOrders; // Ensure one order per person

 uint256 public orderCounter;
 
 // Create co-construction order
 function createOrder(OrderType _type, address _referrer) external payable {
 require(activeOrders[msg.sender] == 0, "Already has active order");
 require(_validateOrderAmount(_type, msg.value), "Invalid amount");
 
 orderCounter++;
 uint256 duration = _getOrderDuration(_type);
 
 orders[orderCounter] = Order({
 id: orderCounter,
 owner: msg.sender,
 amount: msg.value,
 orderType: _type,
 createTime: block.timestamp,
 expireTime: block.timestamp + duration,
 claimed: false
 });
 
 activeOrders[msg.sender] = orderCounter;
 
 // Establish tribal relationship (first time only)
 if (!hasReferrer[msg.sender]) {
 tribeRelations[msg.sender] = _referrer;
 hasReferrer[msg.sender] = true;
 }
 
 emit OrderCreated(orderCounter, msg.sender, _type, msg.value);
 }
 
 // Claim order profits
 function claimOrder(uint256 _orderId) external nonReentrant {
 Order storage order = orders[_orderId];
 require(order.owner == msg.sender, "Not owner");
 require(block.timestamp >= order.expireTime, "Not expired yet");
 require(!order.claimed, "Already claimed");
 
 uint256 returnAmount = _calculateReturn(order.amount, order.orderType);
 
 // Check migration conditions
 if (address(this).balance < returnAmount) {
 _triggerMigration();
 return;
 }
 
 order.claimed = true;
 activeOrders[msg.sender] = 0; // Clear active order
 
 payable(msg.sender).transfer(returnAmount);
 emit OrderClaimed(_orderId, msg.sender, returnAmount);
 }
}
```

Key technical features:

- **Uniqueness Guarantee**: Each address can only have one active order at a time

- **Precise Timing**: Precise expiration handling based on block timestamps

- **Automatic Checking**: Automatic system health check with each withdrawal

### Reward Calculation Algorithm: Precise Calculation of Tribal Contribution Rewards

![Reward Calculation Process](/images/chapter2/chapter2-reward.png)

The calculation of tribal contribution rewards is the most complex part of the system, requiring accurate handling of large and small tribal divisions and level privileges:

```javascript
class RewardCalculator {
 constructor(contractInstance, database) {
 this.contract = contractInstance;
 this.db = database;
 this.levelRates = {
 'AS': { large: 0.30, small: 0.06 },
 'AS1': { large: 0.30, small: 0.10 },
 'AS2': { large: 0.30, small: 0.12 },
 'AS3': { large: 0.30, small: 0.14 },
 'AS4': { large: 0.30, small: 0.16 },
 'AS5': { large: 0.30, small: 0.18 },
 'AS6': { large: 0.30, small: 0.20 }
 };
 this.dailyRewards = { 'Ao': 0.5, 'Am': 7.14, 'AS': 20 };
 }
 
 // Daily reward calculation executed at 23:00
 async calculateDailyRewards() {
 const activeUsers = await this.getActiveUsers();
 const tribeNetworks = await this.buildTribeNetworks();
 
 for (let user of activeUsers) {
 if (user.level === 'Ob' || user.orderType === 'Ao') continue;
 
 const tribes = await this.analyzeTribeStructure(user.address);
 const reward = this.calculateUserReward(user, tribes);
 
 await this.updateRewardBalance(user.address, reward);
 }
 }
 
 // Analyze user's tribal structure
 async analyzeTribeStructure(userAddress) {
 const directReferrals = await this.getDirectReferrals(userAddress);
 const tribePerformances = [];
 
 for (let referral of directReferrals) {
 const performance = await this.calculateTribePerformance(referral);
 tribePerformances.push({
 rootUser: referral,
 totalPerformance: performance.total,
 activeRewards: performance.rewards
 });
 }
 
 // Sort by performance
 tribePerformances.sort((a, b) => b.totalPerformance - a.totalPerformance);

 
 return {
 largeTribe: tribePerformances[0] || null,
 smallTribes: tribePerformances.slice(1)
 };
 }
 
 // Calculate user's tribal contribution reward
 calculateUserReward(user, tribes) {
 const rates = this.levelRates[user.level];
 if (!rates) return 0;
 
 let totalReward = 0;
 
 // Large tribe contribution reward (only root user's personal profit)
 if (tribes.largeTribe) {
 const largeTribeReward = tribes.largeTribe.rootUser.dailyReward;
 totalReward += largeTribeReward * rates.large;
 }
 
 // Small tribe contribution reward (sum of all users' profits)
 const smallTribesReward = tribes.smallTribes.reduce((sum, tribe) => {

 return sum + tribe.activeRewards;
 }, 0);
 totalReward += smallTribesReward * rates.small;
 
 return totalReward;
 }
}
```

### Reward Fund Management Mechanism

Fund management is the key mechanism to ensure reward payments:

```solidity
contract FundManager {
 address public rewardPool;
 
 // Reward withdrawal interface
 function claimRewards(address user, uint256 amount) external onlyRewardSystem {
 require(address(rewardPool).balance >= amount, "Insufficient reward pool");
 payable(user).transfer(amount);
 emit RewardClaimed(user, amount);
 }
 
 // Reward pool balance query
 function getRewardPoolBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
 return address(rewardPool).balance;
 }
}
```

### Level Assessment System: 22:30 Dynamic Rating

The level assessment system ensures that reward privileges match actual contributions in real-time:

```javascript
class LevelAssessment {
 // Daily level assessment executed at 22:30
 async performDailyAssessment() {
 const allUsers = await this.getAllRegisteredUsers();
 const activeOrders = await this.getActiveOrders();
 
 for (let user of allUsers) {
 const newLevel = await this.calculateUserLevel(user, activeOrders);
 await this.updateUserLevel(user.address, newLevel);
 }
 
 // Update legion ranking
 await this.updateLegionRanking();
 }
 
 // Calculate user level
 async calculateUserLevel(user, activeOrders) {
 // Check if has active order
 const hasActiveOrder = activeOrders.some(order => 
 order.owner === user.address && order.orderType === 'AS'
 );
 
 if (!hasActiveOrder) return 'Ob';
 
 const directReferrals = await this.getDirectASReferrals(user.address);
 
 // AS1: Self AS + direct referral of 6 AS
 if (directReferrals.length >= 6) {
 const as1Referrals = directReferrals.filter(ref => ref.level === 'AS1');

 
 // AS2-AS6: Based on number of AS1 downlines
 if (as1Referrals.length >= 5) return 'AS6';
 if (as1Referrals.length >= 4) return 'AS5';
 if (as1Referrals.length >= 3) return 'AS4';
 if (as1Referrals.length >= 2) return 'AS3';
 if (as1Referrals.length >= 1) return 'AS2';
 
 return 'AS1';
 }
 
 return 'AS';
 }
}
```

### Legion Competition System Technical Implementation

The legion system is the highest level of the incentive mechanism, ensuring fair competition through technical means:

```javascript
class LegionSystem {
 // Calculate legion ranking
 async calculateLegionRanking() {
 const as6Users = await this.getAS6Users();
 const rankings = [];
 
 for (let user of as6Users) {
 const smallTribePerformance = await this.calculateSmallTribeTotal(user.address);
 rankings.push({
 user: user.address,
 performance: smallTribePerformance,
 timestamp: Date.now()
 });
 }
 
 // Sort by small tribe performance
 rankings.sort((a, b) => b.performance - a.performance);

 
 // Take top 36
 const legion = rankings.slice(0, 36);
 await this.updateLegionMembers(legion);
 
 return legion;
 }
 
 // Distribute legion rewards every Monday at 01:00
 async distributeLegionRewards() {
 const weeklyPool = await this.getWeeklyLegionPool();
 const legionMembers = await this.getCurrentLegion();
 
 const totalPerformance = legionMembers.reduce((sum, member) => 
 sum + member.performance, 0
 );
 
 for (let member of legionMembers) {
 const reward = weeklyPool * (member.performance / totalPerformance);
 await this.addRewardBalance(member.user, reward);
 }
 
 await this.resetWeeklyPool();
 }
}
```

Through this complete technical implementation, Ant Home ensures that every incentive promise can be precisely executed. Just as Aming discovered from his observations, every number and every reward here is not the subjective decision of managers but the objective execution of smart contracts.

Technology is not only a tool but also a solemn commitment to every digital ant—in this eternal contract, fairness is not a slogan but a sacred law that every line of code is guarding.
